Hereâ€™s a  risk summary for each port:

Telnet (23): Transmits unencrypted credentials, making it vulnerable to interception and brute-force attacks.

HTTP-ALT (8080): Often used for unencrypted web services or admin panels, exposing systems to web-based attacks.

RTSP (554): Can leak audio/video streams and is often unsecured or weakly protected on IP cameras and streaming devices.
